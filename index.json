On the demand side, employers choose a worker based on price and non-price worker attributes such as gender and quality. Since employers do not observe worker quality at the time of hiring, they may rely on gender cues to infer quality. The model of employer choice nests two sources of discrimination: pure employer taste (taste-based) and belief about worker quality by gender (statistical). For the supply side model, workers decide a bid to submit given their attributes, their rivals' attributes, their cost for completing the task, rivals' costs, and their beliefs about employers' preferences. To estimate the model, I use a rich dataset from an online freelance auction platform where employers post tasks and workers submit bids for the tasks. I recover employers' preference primitives and workers' costs for completing the task. From these estimates, I conduct counterfactual simulations in which (a) gender information is blinded and (b) full information about workers' quality is provided.","tags":[],"title":"Gender Discrimination in the Gig Economy: Evidence from Online Auctions for Freelancing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The impact of COVID-19 on K-12 students' use of an artificial intelligence-powered math education app is examined over a 13-week period from a tripartite perspective: quantity, pattern, and pace. The findings show that the threat of the pandemic affects student learning behavior differently. Students who live in the epicenter of the outbreak (vs. those who do not) initially use the education app less immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak only to use it not only more (quantity) but also on a more regular basis (pattern) and at a faster rate in advancing forward in the curriculum (pace). These findings collectively explain behavior that is consistent with compensation for learning loss. The results also partially support the goal proximity effect, by uncovering how goal proximity (e.g., the degree to which the national university entrance exam is imminent) plays a moderating role in explaining the tripartite perspective of student learning behavior. These results have important theoretical and practical implications for understanding how innovative education technologies can facilitate not only student learning during adversity but also support learning recovery after adversity.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Outside the Classroom During a Pandemic: Evidence from an ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence-Based Education App","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

In this study, we investigate whether (a) gender gap exists in performance ratings and customer retention in the gig economy and (b) uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the gap. Using data from QANDA, a leading math learning app in South Korea, we focus on evaluations from students where they are randomly assigned to tutors. In contrast with current literature, our results show that female tutors receive higher ratings than male tutors from both male and female students. We also find that students matched with female tutors are more likely to remain on the platform. We investigate possible mechanisms through which tutor gender affects student satisfaction and retention. The novel data enables us to directly quantify teaching skills and style, where we extract various features from solution images and dialogue narratives between tutor and student utilizing computer vision techniques and text mining. We find that female tutors are more likely to use smile symbols and write solutions with a variety of colors compared to male tutors, which explains about 5.7% and 3.3% of the rating gap between male and female tutors, respectively.","tags":[],"title":"The Gender Gap and its Business Impact: Evidence from an Online Tutoring Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

While existing studies indicate two opposing views of displacement and complement on the relationship between human and AI, we investigate whether AI technology reinstates labor with new tasks, and how AI technology frees people up, allowing them to concentrate on what they can do best (e.g., challenging tasks, difficult problems). To empirically test these questions, we use individual-level data from QANDA, a leading math problem-solver application, which provides both an AI-driven search engine and human tutor services. We find that, as the search engine quality improves, the search engine serves more common and basic questions, leaving only those that are more challenging to the human tutor. This implies that AI displaces labor for routine tasks (i.e., solving simple equations), but complements labor for non-routine tasks (i.e., addressing complicated, challenging, and ambiguous problems), allowing humans to handle tasks that are better suited for them. This study adds to the emerging economics of AI literature by calling further attention to future researchers to explore the substitutable vs. complementary role between human and AI.","tags":[],"title":"Human vs. AI: Will AI Allow Humans to Do Tasks that are Best Suited to Them?","type":"publication"}]
