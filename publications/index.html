To this end, I build an equilibrium model of demand and supply for freelance jobs, in which workers bid prices for each job they are interested in and the employer (who posted the job ad) makes a discrete choice from the offers tendered. The demand for workers in my model nests both taste-based and statistical discrimination against a gender within a random utility framework. I use rich and novel data from an online platform for different kinds of freelancing jobs (e.g., cleaning, moving, and gardening), which enables me to quantify variation in discrimination across job categories. To distinguish the two sources of gender discrimination, I combine past, present, and future performance measures of a worker to estimate workers’ true quality, which is not observed by the employer before hiring. I show that observing this measure is sufficient to separate the effect of taste-based discrimination from statistical discrimination in the hiring process. My estimates suggest that taste-based discrimination is the primary form of discrimination in most jobs. If the platform imposes a gender-blind hiring policy, I find that the welfare of the disfavored group increases by 2% to 18%, depending on the job category.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="Shin:2022:WIP" class="col-sm-10 pl-5"> <div class="title">How Artificial Intelligence, Customers, and Employees Work Together: A Service Triangle Perspective</div> <div class="author"> D.

To address these limitations, this study draws on and extends the service triangle framework, which asserts that three agents are involved for successful service delivery: firm/AI, employees, and customers. On the one hand, supply side research has relied on aggregate level (e.g., sector or national economy) data and this has stifled research on nuanced mediation mechanisms that can only be examined with individual level employee data. On the other hand, demand side studies have focused on individual level customer data that shed light on AI’s impact on customers but have yet to examine how AI affects employee’s well-being (e.g., income). We use individual level employee and customer data to examine both the supply and demand sides of the equation. In due process, we (a) delineate the underlying mechanism of how AI effectiveness impacts employee income, (b) how the mediation pathways differ depending on employee heterogeneity (i.e., expertise), and (c) when customers choose to pay for additional service from a human despite receiving a free solution from AI. To investigate the supply side, we use observational data at the employee level from a global AI powered learning app and find that changes in task volume and margin mediate the relationship between AI effectiveness and employee income but that the pathways differ depending on employee expertise. For low expertise employees, a decrease in task volume plays a mediating role; for high expertise employees, an increase in task margin plays a mediating role. To examine the demand side, we conduct a field experiment and show that when tasks are difficult (vs. easy), customers choose to pay for extra assistance from a human. albeit free service from AI. Furthermore, when customers are confronted with difficult tasks but have limited alternative solution options (e.g., geographical location of residence is rural vs. urban), more customers choose to pay for additional service from a human despite receiving a free solution from AI. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings to the IS literature and practical ramifications to the business community.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="Ko:2022:WIP" class="col-sm-10 pl-5"> <div class="title">The Gender Gap and its Business Impact: Evidence from an Online Tutoring Platform</div> <div class="author"> G.

In this study, we investigate whether (a) gender gap exists in performance ratings and customer retention in the gig economy and (b) uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the gap. Using data from QANDA, a leading math learning app in South Korea, we focus on evaluations from students where they are randomly assigned to tutors. In contrast with current literature, our results show that female tutors receive higher ratings than male tutors from both male and female students. We also find that students matched with female tutors are more likely to remain on the platform. We investigate possible mechanisms through which tutor gender affects student satisfaction and retention. The novel data enables us to directly quantify teaching skills and style, where we extract various features from solution images and dialogue narratives between tutor and student utilizing computer vision techniques and text mining. We find that female tutors are more likely to use smile symbols and write solutions with a variety of colors compared to male tutors, which explains about 5.7% and 3.3% of the rating gap between male and female tutors, respectively.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Ga Young Ko. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-F1R44B805T"></script> <script>function gtag(){window.dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-F1R44B805T");</script> </body> </html>
