To address these limitations, this study draws on and extends the service triangle framework, which asserts that three agents are involved for successful service delivery: firm/AI, employees, and customers. On the one hand, supply side research has relied on aggregate level (e.g., sector or national economy) data and this has stifled research on nuanced mediation mechanisms that can only be examined with individual level employee data. On the other hand, demand side studies have focused on individual level customer data that shed light on AI’s impact on customers but have yet to examine how AI affects employee’s well-being (e.g., income). We use individual level employee and customer data to examine both the supply and demand sides of the equation. In due process, we (a) delineate the underlying mechanism of how AI effectiveness impacts employee income, (b) how the mediation pathways differ depending on employee heterogeneity (i.e., expertise), and (c) when customers choose to pay for additional service from a human despite receiving a free solution from AI. To investigate the supply side, we use observational data at the employee level from a global AI powered learning app and find that changes in task volume and margin mediate the relationship between AI effectiveness and employee income but that the pathways differ depending on employee expertise. For low expertise employees, a decrease in task volume plays a mediating role; for high expertise employees, an increase in task margin plays a mediating role. To examine the demand side, we conduct a field experiment and show that when tasks are difficult (vs. easy), customers choose to pay for extra assistance from a human. albeit free service from AI. Furthermore, when customers are confronted with difficult tasks but have limited alternative solution options (e.g., geographical location of residence is rural vs. urban), more customers choose to pay for additional service from a human despite receiving a free solution from AI.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Prior research on the relationship among artificial intelligence (AI), customers, and employees (ACE) has focused on either the supply side (i.e., AI-employee relationship) or the demand side (i.e., AI-customer relationship) but rarely on both. To address these limitations, this study draws on and extends the service triangle framework, which asserts that three agents are involved for successful service delivery: firm/AI, employees, and customers. On the one hand, supply side research has relied on aggregate level (e.g., sector or national economy) data and this has stifled research on nuanced mediation mechanisms that can only be examined with individual level employee data. On the other hand, demand side studies have focused on individual level customer data that shed light on AI’s impact on customers but have yet to examine how AI affects employee’s well-being (e.g., income). We use individual level employee and customer data to examine both the supply and demand sides of the equation. In due process, we (a) delineate the underlying mechanism of how AI effectiveness impacts employee income, (b) how the mediation pathways differ depending on employee heterogeneity (i.e., expertise), and (c) when customers choose to pay for additional service from a human despite receiving a free solution from AI. To investigate the supply side, we use observational data at the employee level from a global AI powered learning app and find that changes in task volume and margin mediate the relationship between AI effectiveness and employee income but that the pathways differ depending on employee expertise. For low expertise employees, a decrease in task volume plays a mediating role; for high expertise employees, an increase in task margin plays a mediating role. To examine the demand side, we conduct a field experiment and show that when tasks are difficult (vs. easy), customers choose to pay for extra assistance from a human. albeit free service from AI. Furthermore, when customers are confronted with difficult tasks but have limited alternative solution options (e.g., geographical location of residence is rural vs. urban), more customers choose to pay for additional service from a human despite receiving a free solution from AI. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings to the IS literature and practical ramifications to the business community.</p>
